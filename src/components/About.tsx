        I’m Tanishq Gopani, a video editor and filmmaking nerd who’s been doing this for 5 years now. Editing is my space the one place where everything just makes sense.<br></br>
I’ve worked on 100+ projects so far, each one teaching me something new. Someday, I want to direct my own film. Until then, I’m here cutting, creating, and chasing that feeling only a good story can give.
